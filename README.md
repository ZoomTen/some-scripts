# some-scripts

These are mainly supposed work on any **Linux** distro with supported packages, but with a few modifications you can run it on a **Mac**, a **BSD** distribution or even through the snort Windows 10™™™ Bash thingy!!!

It's under **The Unlicense**, or in other words do whatever the heck you want with it LOL
